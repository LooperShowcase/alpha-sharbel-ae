      <h1>
        In a previous article, I discussed several technical aspects concerning
        Intel’s manufacturing operations, in light of the 7nm delays. Still,
        history could have turned out much differently than the current events.
        Intel had a grand plan for transistor domination and leadership. This
        article tells the (unsung) story of Intel’s quest for unquestionable
        process leadership that instead resulted in its loss of process
        leadership. Intel lost its leadership due to the absence (delay) of EUV
        lithography, but EUV has now become a mature technology. This means
        Intel can come back. Improved technology going forward will lead to a
        virtuous cycle of higher gross margin and fewer market share losses.
