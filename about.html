    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>
      Intel Corporation is an American multinational corporation and technology
      company headquartered in Santa Clara, California, in Silicon Valley. It is
      the world's largest semiconductor chip manufacturer by revenue,[3][4] and
      is the developer of the x86 series of microprocessors, the processors
      found in most personal computers (PCs). Incorporated in Delaware,[5] Intel
      ranked No. 45 in the 2020 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States
      corporations by total revenue during nearly a decade, from 2007 to 2016
      fiscal years.[6] Intel supplies microprocessors for computer system
      manufacturers such as Lenovo, HP, and Dell. Intel also manufactures
      motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated
      circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other
      devices related to communications and computing. Intel was founded on July
      18, 1968, by semiconductor pioneers Gordon Moore (of Moore's law) and
      Robert Noyce, and is associated with the executive leadership and vision
      of Andrew Grove. The company's name was conceived as portmanteau of the
      words integrated and electronics, with co-founder Noyce having been a key
      inventor of the integrated circuit (microchip). The fact that "intel" is
      the term for intelligence information also made the name appropriate.[7]
      Intel was an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, which
      represented the majority of its business until 1981. Although Intel
      created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971, it was
      not until the success of the personal computer (PC) that this became its
      primary business. During the 1990s, Intel invested heavily in new
      microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the computer
      industry. During this period, Intel became the dominant supplier of
      microprocessors for PCs and was known for aggressive and anti-competitive
      tactics in defense of its market position, particularly against Advanced
      Micro Devices (AMD), as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control over
      the direction of the PC industry.[8][9] The Open Source Technology Center
      at Intel hosts PowerTOP and LatencyTOP, and supports other open-source
      projects such as Wayland, Mesa, Threading Building Blocks (TBB), and
      Xen.[10]
